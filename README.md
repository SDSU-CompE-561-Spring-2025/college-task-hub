# TaskU

A platform designed to help college students find quick, flexible jobs during their free time. Students can:

- Sign up and create a profile
- Browse or get notified of nearby gigs that match their skills
- Accept or decline tasks such as tutoring, dog walking, helping with moves, etc.

Clients can post tasks with the required skills, and the platform automatically pings matching students in the area.

The main goal is to offer students a way to earn extra cash without committing to a regular job.
